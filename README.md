# nextnano-tutorials
Tutorial input files for the nextnano software

In this repository, nextnano users can upload their input files and results, e.g. if they generated a figure in a publication, they can upload all necessary information so that others can reproduce, check, verify and improve their results.

This will help making scientific simulations more transparent and reproducible. As a side effect, these publications might get more citations.

I hope this repository will be useful for many PhD students!
